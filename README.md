# Auto Keyword Linker for Obsidian
v2.0.7

Automatically convert keywords into wiki-style links throughout your Obsidian vault. This plugin helps you build a richly interconnected knowledge graph by intelligently linking keywords to their target notes, creating a web of backlinks that reveals hidden connections in your notes.

## 🌟 Overview

Auto Keyword Linker streamlines the process of creating and maintaining links in your Obsidian vault. Instead of manually typing `[[brackets]]` around every mention of a person, place, concept, or project, simply define your keywords once and let the plugin handle the rest. The plugin intelligently finds and links keywords while respecting existing links, code blocks, and other markdown formatting.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### Automated Graph Building

One of the most powerful features of this plugin is its ability to **automatically build your knowledge graph through backlinks**. Every time a keyword is linked, Obsidian creates a bidirectional connection between notes:

- **Automatic Backlinks**: When a keyword is linked in your meeting notes, the target note automatically shows a backlink to that meeting
- **Discover Hidden Connections**: Your graph view reveals relationships you might not have noticed manually
- **Effortless Network Effects**: As you write naturally, your vault becomes increasingly interconnected without extra effort
- **Rich Context**: Each note's backlinks section shows every mention across your vault, providing comprehensive context

### Time Savings

- **No More Repetitive Linking**: Stop manually adding brackets around the same keywords hundreds of times
- **Bulk Operations**: Link keywords across your entire vault in seconds instead of hours
- **Consistent Linking**: Never forget to link an important term again
- **🆕 AI-Powered Suggestions**: Automatically discover potential keywords from your existing notes

### Flexibility

- **Keyword Variations**: Handle different spellings, nicknames, or abbreviations automatically (e.g., "ML", "machine learning", "Machine Learning" all link to the same note)
- **Preview Before Apply**: See exactly what will change before committing
- **Granular Control**: Link keywords in a single note or across your entire vault

- **🆕 Scoped Linking**: Restrict keywords to specific folders for context-aware linking
- Vault Wide: Links the keyword anywhere in your vault
- Same folder only: Links keywords ONLY to target notes in the same folder as the current note being processed.
- Source in specific folder: Links keywords ONLY when the current note (source) is in a specified folder. A folder must be set.
- Target in specific folder: Links keywords ONLY to target notes in a specified folder. A folder must be set.

- **🆕 Relative Links**: Option to create relative path links instead of absolute paths
- **🆕 Block References**: Link directly to specific blocks within notes

## ✨ Features

### 1. **🆕 Smart Keyword Suggestion System**

**NEW**: Let the plugin analyze your vault and suggest potential keywords automatically.

**How it works**:
- Command: "Suggest keywords from notes"
- Scans all markdown files in your vault
- Extracts common phrases and terms (2-3 words)
- Filters out common stop words
- Shows frequency count for each suggestion
- Preview which notes contain each suggested keyword
- Select suggestions to add as new keywords or variations

**Interactive Suggestion Modal**:
- **Search**: Filter suggestions in real-time
- **Sort Options**: 
  - By frequency (most common first)
  - By phrase length (longest first)
  - Alphabetically
- **Bulk Actions**:
  - Select All
  - Deselect All
  - Toggle Selection
- **Smart Assignment**: Choose whether to add as new keyword or variation of existing

**Benefits**:
- **Discover Hidden Patterns**: Find commonly-used terms you didn't realize were important
- **Build Keywords Faster**: No need to manually think of every term
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Frequency counts show which terms matter most
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Let AI do the heavy lifting of keyword discovery

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Run "Suggest keywords from notes"
2. Plugin analyzes vault, finds "machine learning" appears 47 times across 12 notes
3. Review suggestions, see preview of affected notes
4. Select interesting suggestions
5. Choose whether to add as new keyword or variation
6. Keywords automatically configured
```

### 2. **🆕 Advanced Link Scoping**

**NEW**: Control where keywords are linked with granular scope settings.

**Link Scope Options**:
- **Vault-wide** (default): Link this keyword everywhere in your vault
- **Folder-specific**: Only link this keyword within a specific folder and its subfolders

**How it works**:
- Configure scope per keyword in settings
- Choose "Folder-specific" and select the folder path
- Plugin only processes keywords when they appear in the specified scope
- Other occurrences outside the scope are ignored

**Use Cases**:
- **Context-Sensitive Terms**: "Sprint" means different things in fitness notes vs. project notes
- **Department-Specific Jargon**: Technical terms only relevant in specific project folders
- **Ambiguous Keywords**: Words with multiple meanings depending on context
- **Team Boundaries**: Separate keyword sets for different teams/departments

**Example Configuration**:
```
Keyword: Sprint
Target: Projects/Agile/Sprint Planning
Scope: Folder-specific
Scope Folder: Projects/
→ Only links "Sprint" in the Projects folder

Keyword: Sprint
Target: Fitness/Running/Sprint Training
Scope: Folder-specific
Scope Folder: Health/
→ Only links "Sprint" in the Health folder
```

**Benefits**:
- **Avoid False Positives**: Prevent linking when keyword has different meaning
- **Organized Workspaces**: Keep different domains of knowledge separate
- **Reduced Noise**: Target notes only show relevant backlinks
- **Flexible Configuration**: Mix vault-wide and scoped keywords

### 3. **🆕 Relative Link Support**

**NEW**: Create relative path links instead of absolute paths for better portability.

**How it works**:
- Enable "Use relative links" for any keyword
- Links are created relative to the source note's location
- Results in cleaner, more portable vault structure

**Comparison**:
```
Absolute Link (default):
[[Projects/Website Redesign]]

Relative Link (when enabled):
[[../Projects/Website Redesign]]
```

**Benefits**:
- **Better Portability**: Easier to move folders around
- **Cleaner Paths**: Less visual clutter in reading mode
- **Vault Organization**: More flexible folder structure changes
- **Cross-Platform**: Some sync solutions prefer relative paths

**When to Use**:
- Vaults with complex folder hierarchies
- Notes that might be reorganized frequently
- Projects shared across different systems
- When folder structure is more important than flat linking

### 4. **🆕 Block Reference Linking**

**NEW**: Link directly to specific blocks, headings, or sections within target notes.

**How it works**:
- Add block reference in keyword configuration (e.g., `#^block-id` or `#heading`)
- Links automatically include the block reference
- Clicking link jumps directly to that section

**Supported Reference Types**:
- **Block IDs**: `#^unique-block-id`
- **Headings**: `#Heading Name`
- **Nested Headings**: `#Parent Heading > Nested Heading`

**Example Configuration**:
```
Keyword: API Documentation
Target: Development/API Guide
Block Reference: #Authentication
→ Creates: [[Development/API Guide#Authentication]]

Keyword: Meeting Protocol
Target: Procedures/Meetings
Block Reference: #^meeting-checklist
→ Creates: [[Procedures/Meetings#^meeting-checklist]]
```

**Benefits**:
- **Precise Navigation**: Jump to exact relevant section
- **Better Context**: Readers land on the right information immediately
- **Living Documentation**: Link to specific procedures or checklists
- **Reduced Confusion**: No need to search through long target notes

### 5. **Keyword Management with Variations**

Define keywords and their variations in an intuitive interface. Each keyword consists of:

- **Keyword**: The primary search term (e.g., "Machine Learning")
- **Target Note**: The note to link to (e.g., "Concepts/Machine Learning")
- **Variations**: Alternative spellings or abbreviations (e.g., "ML, machine learning, neural networks")
- **🆕 Link Scope**: Where this keyword should be linked (vault-wide or folder-specific)
- **🆕 Relative Links**: Option to use relative paths
- **🆕 Block Reference**: Optional block/heading reference

**How it works**: When you define variations, all forms automatically link to the same target note. This is perfect for:
- People with nicknames or multiple name formats
- Projects with acronyms
- Concepts with alternative terminology
- Companies with abbreviated names

**Example Configuration**:
```
Keyword: Machine Learning
Target: Concepts/Machine Learning
Variations: ML, machine learning, neural networks
Link Scope: Vault-wide
Use Relative Links: No
Block Reference: #Overview
Enable Tags: Yes
```

Any mention of "Machine Learning", "ML", "machine learning", or "neural networks" in your notes will automatically link to "Concepts/Machine Learning#Overview".

### 6. **Automatic Tag Management**

Each keyword can now automatically add tags to both the source note (where the keyword appears) and the target note (where it links to). This creates a powerful dual system of linking and tagging for enhanced discoverability.

**How it works**:
- Enable "Enable tags" for any keyword in the settings
- When that keyword is linked, a tag is automatically added to the end of both notes
- Tags are sanitized (spaces become hyphens, special characters removed)
- Debounced to prevent conflicts during auto-save (1-second delay)

**Example**:
```
Keyword: Project Momentum
Target: Projects/Momentum Initiative
Enable Tags: ✓

Result:
- Source note gets tag: #project-momentum
- Target note gets tag: #project-momentum
- Both notes are now discoverable via tag search
```

**Benefits**:
- **Dual Discovery**: Find notes by both backlinks AND tags
- **Category Building**: Tags automatically group related notes
- **Flexible Navigation**: Use Obsidian's tag pane alongside graph view
- **No Duplicates**: Plugin checks for existing tags before adding
- **Clean Placement**: Tags are added to the end of notes in a consistent format

**Tag Format**:
- Added at the end of notes after double line break
- Multiple tags from different keywords are combined on one line
- Example: `#machine-learning #neural-networks #deep-learning`

### 7. **Import/Export Keywords**

Easily backup, share, or migrate your keyword configurations using JSON import/export.

**Export Keywords**:
- Command: "Export keywords to JSON"
- Creates a timestamped JSON file in your vault root
- Example filename: `auto-keyword-linker-export-2025-01-15.json`
- Contains all keywords, targets, variations, scoping, and tag settings

**Import Keywords**:
- Command: "Import keywords from JSON"
- Opens a modal showing all JSON files in your vault
- **Smart Merging**: Automatically handles conflicts
  - New keywords are added
  - Existing keywords merge variations (no duplicates)
  - Preserves your current keyword settings
- Import summary shows what was added/merged

**Use Cases**:
- **Backup**: Export before major changes to your keyword list
- **Sharing**: Share keyword configurations with team members
- **Migration**: Move keywords between vaults
- **Version Control**: Track keyword configuration changes over time
- **🆕 Suggestions Export**: Export suggested keywords for team review

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Configure keywords in Vault A
2. Export to JSON
3. Copy JSON to Vault B
4. Import in Vault B
5. Keywords now synchronized across vaults
```

### 8. **Statistics and Analytics**

Track your linking activity and keyword usage with built-in statistics.

**Command**: "View statistics"

**Metrics Tracked**:
- **Total Links Created**: Cumulative count of all keyword links created
- **Total Notes Processed**: Number of notes that have been processed
- **Total Keywords Configured**: Current number of active keywords
- **Last Run Date**: Timestamp of most recent linking operation
- **Keyword Breakdown**: List of all configured keywords with their variations and settings

**Viewing Statistics**:

- Modal displays comprehensive statistics and keyword overview

**Benefits**:
- **Progress Tracking**: See how your knowledge graph grows over time
- **Configuration Review**: Quick overview of all configured keywords
- **Activity Monitoring**: Understand when and how often you're using the plugin

### 9. **Smart Linking Engine**

The plugin uses intelligent pattern matching to find keywords while avoiding false positives:

- **Word Boundary Detection**: Only matches whole words (won't match "the" in "theme")
- **Context Awareness**: Skips keywords already inside links, avoiding `[[ [[keyword]] ]]`
- **Code Block Protection**: Ignores keywords inside code blocks, inline code, or markdown links
- **Hashtag Protection**: Skips keywords preceded by # to avoid interfering with existing tags
- **URL Detection**: Comprehensive URL pattern matching prevents linking keywords in web addresses
- **Alias Protection**: Doesn't modify the alias portion of links `[[target|alias]]`
- **Image Embed Protection**: Skips keywords in image embeds `![[image]]`
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Ignores keywords in frontmatter metadata
- **Case Sensitivity Toggle**: Choose whether "keyword" should match "Keyword"

### 10. **Preview Mode**

Before making any changes, preview exactly what will be linked:

- **Visual Preview**: See each keyword that will be linked with the surrounding context
- **Change Statistics**: Know how many links will be created in how many notes
- **Safe Exploration**: Preview shows what *would* happen without modifying files
- **Bulk Preview**: When processing all notes, see a comprehensive summary before applying

  - Runs in background without interrupting workflow
  - Maintains cursor position
  - Debounced tag addition prevents conflicts
  - Recursion prevention for safety

### 12. **Automatic Note Creation**

When a target note doesn't exist, the plugin can automatically create it:

- **Vault-wide duplicate checking**: Searches entire vault before creating
- **Custom folder location**: Place new notes in specified folder
- **Template support**: Use customizable templates for new notes
- **Template variables**:
  - `{{keyword}}`: Inserts the keyword text
  - `{{date}}`: Inserts current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

3. Explain the use case for feature requests
4. Include your Obsidian version and OS

## 💡 Tips and Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Auto-Link on Save for Seamless Workflow

Enable "Auto-link on save" and forget about linking entirely. Just write naturally and save when you're done. Your graph builds itself, and tags are added automatically.

### Tip 2: Preview First, Apply Later

When processing all notes for the first time, always use preview mode. This helps you catch:
- Keywords that are too generic
- Unexpected matches
- Missing variations

### Tip 3: Combine with Templates

Use Obsidian's template plugin alongside Auto Keyword Linker. Create templates for meeting notes, daily notes, etc., then let Auto Keyword Linker handle the linking when you fill them out.

### Tip 4: Regular Bulk Processing

Even with auto-link on save, periodically run "Link keywords in all notes" to catch any notes you edited outside Obsidian or before adding new keywords.

### Tip 5: Use Descriptive Target Names

Instead of linking to "Note.md", link to "People/Alice Johnson.md" or "Projects/Website Redesign.md". This makes your backlinks and graph more informative.

### Tip 6: Strategic Tag Usage

Don't enable tags for every keyword. Focus on:
- High-level categories (people, projects, concepts)
- Topics you search for frequently
- Keywords that benefit from both link and tag discovery

### Tip 7: Export Before Major Changes

Always export your keywords before:
- Bulk processing your entire vault
- Making significant changes to keyword list
- Testing new variations or patterns
- Sharing your vault with others

### Tip 8: Monitor Statistics

Review statistics monthly to:
- Track knowledge graph growth
- Identify your most-linked keywords
- Understand your linking patterns
- Justify the plugin's value to yourself or team

### Tip 9: Import from Team Members

If working in a shared vault:
1. Each person configures their keywords
2. Export configurations
3. One person imports all configs (smart merge handles duplicates)
4. Export the merged config
5. Everyone imports the final version

### Tip 10: Use Tags for Alternative Discovery

When you can't remember which note mentioned something:
1. Search by link/backlink (traditional method)
2. Search by tag (new alternative method)
3. Use both for comprehensive results
4. Tag pane shows all tagged notes at a glance

### 🆕 Tip 11: Leverage Keyword Suggestions

Monthly workflow:
1. Run "Suggest keywords from notes"
2. Sort by frequency
3. Identify emerging themes/patterns
4. Add top suggestions as keywords
5. Your linking becomes more comprehensive over time

### 🆕 Tip 12: Use Scoping for Ambiguous Terms

When a word has multiple meanings:
1. Create separate keywords with same name
2. Set different scopes (folder-specific)
3. Configure different targets
4. Context determines which link is created

### 🆕 Tip 13: Block References for Long Guides

For reference documents:
1. Add headings or block IDs to key sections
2. Configure keywords with block references
3. Links jump directly to relevant section
4. Reduces friction in daily workflow

### 🆕 Tip 14: Relative Links for Portable Vaults

If you frequently reorganize:
1. Enable "Use relative links" for relevant keywords
2. Folder moves don't break links as easily
3. Better for vaults shared across different systems
